# 3D HUMAN BONE MANIPULATION
A simple 3D bone anatomy viewer built with Three.js that allows users to interact with a 3D bone model.

### PROJECT STORY
The 3D Human Bone Manipulation System was developed by our group with the goal of making anatomy learning simple, interactive, and educational. Our group decided to create a web-based 3D visualization system that allows users to explore and manipulate human bones in real time. The project emphasizes clarity, ease of use, and educational value, making it suitable for students, beginners, and anyone interested in learning simple human bone anatomy through interactive technology.

### PROJECT CONCEPT
This project is an interactive 3D application that displays human bone models in a virtual environment. Users can rotate, zoom, and pan the model to view bone structures from different angles. By using 3D visualization, the system enhances spatial understanding and provides a more engaging alternative to static learning materials. The concept focuses on visual learning, hands-on interaction, and web accessibility, ensuring the system can be used directly through a browser without complex installations.
